<h1>What Does a Google Ads Click Actually Cost a Plumber? Real CPC Data From 4 Countries</h1>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div>February 7, 2026</div>
</div>

<p class="lead">You're great at fixing pipes. You can handle a burst water main at 3 AM, clear a blocked drain in under an hour, and install a water heater before lunch. But getting the phone to ring? That's a different kind of problem.</p>

<p>If you've looked into Google Ads &mdash; or if you're already running them and wondering where your money is going &mdash; you're not alone. Plumbers across the US, UK, Australia, and Canada are all asking the same question: <strong>is this actually worth what I'm paying per click?</strong></p>

<p>We pulled real data from Google's Keyword Planner across these four markets to give you a straight answer. Not theory, not "it depends" &mdash; actual numbers showing what advertisers are paying right now. Whether you're a one-van operation deciding if Google Ads is worth trying, or a team of ten looking to spend smarter, this data is for you.</p>

<h2>The Baseline: What "Plumber Near Me" Costs in Each Market</h2>

<p>Let's start with the most-searched plumbing keyword in every country: "plumber near me." This is the term your potential customers type when they need help and haven't picked someone yet.</p>

<div class="table-wrapper">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Your Market</th><th>Searches/Month</th><th>You'll Pay (Low)</th><th>You'll Pay (High)</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>US</td><td class="num">823,000</td><td class="num">$15.75</td><td class="num">$109.90</td></tr>
<tr><td>UK</td><td class="num">90,500</td><td class="num">&pound;3.86</td><td class="num">&pound;20.78</td></tr>
<tr><td>Australia</td><td class="num">49,500</td><td class="num">A$12.33</td><td class="num">A$54.56</td></tr>
<tr><td>Canada</td><td class="num">49,500</td><td class="num">C$4.56</td><td class="num">C$34.07</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>The range is wide because Google Ads is an auction. Where you land depends on your area, your quality score, and how many other plumbers are bidding in your zip code. But the ballpark is real: if you're a US plumber, expect to pay somewhere between $16 and $110 every time someone clicks your ad for "plumber near me."</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Let's put that in practical terms.</strong>
Say you're a US plumber with a $1,000/month ad budget, and your average cost per click is $50 (roughly the midpoint). That gives you about 20 clicks per month. If one in five turns into a job, you're getting 4 new customers from Google Ads. Whether that's worth it depends on your average job value &mdash; which brings us to a critical point about how keyword pricing actually works.
</div>

<p>For UK and Canadian plumbers, the same $1,000-equivalent budget stretches much further. At &pound;12 average CPC in the UK, you're looking at around 80 clicks per month &mdash; a very different equation.</p>

<h2>Why Emergency Keywords Cost $146 Per Click (And Why It Might Still Be Worth It)</h2>

<p>Across every country we analyzed, "emergency plumber" commands the highest cost per click. By a lot.</p>

<div class="table-wrapper">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Your Market</th><th>Searches/Month</th><th>You'll Pay (Low)</th><th>You'll Pay (High)</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>US</td><td class="num">74,000</td><td class="num">$30.92</td><td class="num highlight">$146.36</td></tr>
<tr><td>UK</td><td class="num">14,800</td><td class="num">&pound;10.04</td><td class="num">&pound;43.19</td></tr>
<tr><td>Australia</td><td class="num">6,600</td><td class="num">A$11.56</td><td class="num">A$57.18</td></tr>
<tr><td>Canada</td><td class="num">5,400</td><td class="num">C$7.44</td><td class="num">C$46.68</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>$146 for a single click sounds insane. But here's why advertisers keep paying it: <strong>CPC reflects the value of the customer, not just the number of competitors.</strong></p>

<p>Think about who's searching "emergency plumber" at 2 AM with water pouring through their ceiling. They're not comparing three quotes &mdash; they're calling the first plumber who answers. The conversion rate is near 100%. The job itself is $500 to $2,000+. And the plumber who saves someone from a flood often becomes their go-to for life.</p>

<p>That's why the CPC is high: advertisers can afford $146 per click because the return justifies it. This same logic applies across the board &mdash; keywords are expensive when the clicks are likely to convert into high-value jobs, and cheap when they're not. We'll see this pattern again when we compare service-specific keywords below.</p>

<div class="callout warning">
<strong>The danger is bidding without geographic limits.</strong>
If your ad shows up for someone 100 miles away who will never hire you, you just wasted $146. Set your radius to the area you can actually reach &mdash; typically 30 to 60 minutes of driving time &mdash; and use call tracking so you know exactly which clicks turn into real calls.
</div>

<p>In Australia, this is especially important: "emergency plumber near me" tops out at A$62.70 per click, the highest relative to market size of any country. Every wasted Australian emergency click stings.</p>

<h2>The Language Trap That Wastes Your Budget</h2>

<p>This one blindsides a lot of plumbers, especially if you've ever read a marketing guide written for a different country.</p>

<p>The words people use to search for the exact same plumbing problem are completely different depending on where they live:</p>

<div class="table-wrapper">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>The Problem</th><th>US Term</th><th>Volume</th><th>UK Term</th><th>Volume</th><th>AU Term</th><th>Volume</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Blocked drain</td><td>"drain clog"</td><td class="num">12,100</td><td>"drain unblocking"</td><td class="num highlight">33,100</td><td>"blocked drain"</td><td class="num">3,600</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leaky tap</td><td>"faucet repair"</td><td class="num">4,400</td><td>"leaking tap repair"</td><td class="num">3,600</td><td>"leaking tap repair"</td><td class="num">&mdash;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Look at those numbers for drain services in the UK: "drain unblocking" gets <strong>33,100 searches per month</strong>, while "drain clog" &mdash; the American term &mdash; gets just 1,600. That's a 20:1 ratio.</p>

<p><strong>Here's where it costs you money.</strong> If you're a UK plumber and you hired a marketing agency that used American keyword lists, or you followed a US-based "how to run Google Ads for plumbers" guide, you might be bidding on "drain clog." You're paying for clicks on a term almost nobody in your country searches for, while missing the term that 95% of your potential customers actually use.</p>

<p>The same trap works in reverse. If you're an American plumber somehow bidding on "drain unblocking," you're wasting money on a term that barely exists in US search behavior.</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>What to do:</strong>
Before spending a single dollar on Google Ads, open Google Keyword Planner and search for your services in your specific area. Don't assume &mdash; verify. The 20 minutes you spend checking this could save you thousands in wasted ad spend.
</div>

<p>Australia sits in an interesting middle ground, using a mix of American and British English terms. "Blocked drain" is the dominant term (3,600/month), but you'll also find some American terms showing up. If you're an Australian plumber, test both variants &mdash; you might pick up cheaper clicks on less-competitive terms.</p>

<h2>Your Country's Homes Determine Your Keywords</h2>

<p>Here's something most plumbing advertisers never think about: the equipment installed in homes varies dramatically by country, and that completely changes which keywords exist.</p>

<p>Take "water heater repair":</p>

<div class="table-wrapper">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Keyword</th><th>US</th><th>UK</th><th>Australia</th><th>Canada</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>water heater repair</td><td class="num highlight">90,500</td><td class="num">2,400</td><td class="num">210</td><td class="num">2,400</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>In the US, this is a massive keyword &mdash; 90,500 monthly searches at up to $109.75 per click. In Australia? Just 210 searches. That's a 430:1 difference.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> American homes overwhelmingly use tank-style water heaters. When one fails, the homeowner searches "water heater repair." UK homes use boilers. Australian homes increasingly use instantaneous (tankless) systems or solar hot water.</p>

<p>The plumbing infrastructure is different, so the search behavior is different, so the keyword strategy must be different.</p>

<p><strong>If you're a US plumber</strong> who does a lot of water heater work, this is one of your highest-value keyword categories. At 90,500 monthly searches, there's significant volume, and a water heater replacement can easily run $1,000&ndash;3,000 &mdash; justifying the high CPC.</p>

<p><strong>If you're a UK plumber</strong>, don't waste budget on "water heater repair." Instead, look at boiler-related terms, which are where your actual customers are searching.</p>

<p><strong>If you're an Australian plumber</strong>, the equivalent terms are "hot water system repair" or specific brand-related searches. The volume is lower, but so is the competition.</p>

<p>The broader lesson: don't copy keyword lists from another country's plumber. What works in the US is irrelevant in the UK, and vice versa. Your keywords must reflect what's actually installed in the homes in your service area.</p>

<h2>Match Your Keywords to Your Business</h2>

<p>Now that you understand why some keywords cost more than others (higher conversion, higher job value), let's use that to pick the right ones for your business:</p>

<div class="table-wrapper">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Keyword (US)</th><th>Searches/Month</th><th>Bid High</th><th>Typical Job Value</th><th>Conversion</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>plumber</td><td class="num">673,000</td><td class="num">$111.34</td><td>Varies</td><td>Low &mdash; generic browsing</td></tr>
<tr><td>emergency plumber</td><td class="num">74,000</td><td class="num">$146.36</td><td>$500&ndash;2,000+</td><td>Very high</td></tr>
<tr><td>drain cleaning</td><td class="num">110,000</td><td class="num highlight">$62.49</td><td>$150&ndash;300</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>
<tr><td>toilet repair</td><td class="num">12,100</td><td class="num highlight">$57.83</td><td>$100&ndash;250</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>
<tr><td>water heater repair</td><td class="num">90,500</td><td class="num">$109.75</td><td>$1,000&ndash;3,000</td><td>High</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>The pattern is clear: CPC tracks the likely return, not just competition. "Water heater repair" costs almost as much as "plumber" because the job value is $1,000+. "Toilet repair" is cheap because it's a $150 job and the searcher might be looking for DIY advice.</p>

<p><strong>The smart approach:</strong> bid on the services you're best at and most profitable doing. If your bread and butter is emergency work, the $146 clicks are your best investment. If you run a high-volume drain cleaning operation, the $62 clicks at 110,000 monthly searches could work better. Don't chase cheap clicks &mdash; chase profitable clicks.</p>

<h2>Your Action Plan</h2>

<p>Whether you're starting from scratch or optimizing an existing campaign, here's what to do with this data:</p>

<ol class="action-list">
<li><strong>Know your market's price.</strong> Open Google Keyword Planner and check CPCs for your specific service area. The numbers in this article are national averages &mdash; your local market may be higher or lower depending on competition in your area.</li>
<li><strong>Use your country's language.</strong> Verify which terms your local customers actually search. UK: "drain unblocking," not "drain clog." US: "faucet repair," not "leaking tap." Australia: check both variants. Twenty minutes of research saves thousands in wasted spend.</li>
<li><strong>Geo-target to your actual service area.</strong> This is non-negotiable for expensive keywords. Set your radius to the area you can realistically drive to &mdash; usually 30&ndash;60 minutes. Every click from outside your service area is money down the drain.</li>
<li><strong>Match keywords to your infrastructure.</strong> Bid on "water heater repair" in the US, "boiler repair" in the UK. Your keywords should reflect what's in your customers' homes, not what's in a generic marketing template.</li>
<li><strong>Think in ROI, not just CPC.</strong> A $146 click that turns into a $2,000 job beats a $58 click that goes nowhere. Choose keywords based on the full picture: cost per click, conversion rate, and average job value for that service.</li>
</ol>

<div class="bottom-line">
